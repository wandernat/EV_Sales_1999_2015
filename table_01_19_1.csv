"Sales of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs- including all-electric vehicles and electric vehicles with a gasoline-assist engine) grew rapidly in 2011 to 2014 due to technology improvements, cost reduction, increase in model choice, increase in charging infrastructure, and economic recovery. Sales decreased slightly in 2015 due to low gasoline prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
